# Digits Solver

Naive solver for https://www.nytimes.com/games/digits. Mostly just experiments 
with some libs I wanted to try.

## Run CLI

In your terminal run: `cargo run --bin digits-cli` or for the optimized version:
`cargo run --release --bin digits-cli`.

## Run WEB

In your terminal run: `cd web && trunk serve` or just go to the
[github page](https://digits.j2e.co/).
